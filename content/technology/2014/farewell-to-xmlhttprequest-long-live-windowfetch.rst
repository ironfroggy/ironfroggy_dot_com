The days of XMLHttpRequest and weird choices for capitalization are
numbered. WhatWG has a spec ready for some time now to replace it:
window.fetch. Just look at how easy it is.

Just look at how nicer that is all with soon-to-be native APIs. But you
don't have to wait, because there is a polyfill available. Start using
the `Fetch Polyfill <https://github.com/github/fetch>`__ in your
projects today.
