I released ExtSession 0.3 today. Added error reporting through the
result objects, iteration over remote objects, cleaned up much of the
code, and did a some bugfixing.

Also included a tutorial on extsession usage, so hopefully some of the
people that had difficulty can read that and understand how to use it.

`Go and get it. <http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/ExtSession>`__
