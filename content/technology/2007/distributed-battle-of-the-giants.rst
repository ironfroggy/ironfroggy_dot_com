Google and Yahoo are facing each other on a lot of battle grounds, and
some of them are less public than others. Research is key to the long
term survival of both companies, and lots of information is the bread
and butter of the two. Without effective technology to burrow through
unheard of volumes of data in record time, neither will make it. Some of
the things coming out of this struggle are interesting.

New languages are under development by the research teams at both
Yahoo and Google.

`Sawzall <http://labs.google.com/papers/sawzall.html>`__ is a the topic
of a research paper from `Rob Pike <http://labs.google.com/people/r>`__,
Sean Dorward, Robert Griesemer, and Sean Quinlan.

`Pig <http://research.yahoo.com/project/pig>`__, with a much less
elegant name, is a working language from Yahoo Research. Off the bat,
note that Sawzall is a paper, and you can download Pig's source today.

If Google has an implementation of Sawzall, they are not making it
public at this time.

Both are based around respective implementations of the popular
concurrency algorithm, MapReduce, originally a Google creation. Yahoo
supports an open source implementation of this algorithm, named
`Hadoop <http://lucene.apache.org/hadoop/>`__. Google has yet and likely
won't release source code or open up their MapReduce system, although
much information is available through their research papers.

I guess I just find it interesting that although Google is considered so
often to be the geeks company, and a more open and public loving
corporate entity, much of it sometimes seems to just be face without
substance. Yahoo is the one supporting the open source project, instead
of a closed internal solution, and their concurrency language is
available freely with its source code. Sometimes, I wonder if Yahoo is
more in line with the communities than Google.
