I've been toying with the idea of increasing how much I might get back
from this little place. At times it gets down right exciting to watch my
hits rise day after day, until I get writers block again and drop back
to double digits for a month or so. I can't help but listen to the
entrepreneurial spirit in me that suggests a little more devotion and
discipline on my part would push the pocket pennies to a threshold the
likes of my ramen-eating self would just drool over. Hell, I could even
buy two flavors of ramen.

So, I played with a few things. I naively made an attempt to jury-rig
my Google Adsense snippets into my actual posts, to test what would come
up in my reader. Squat, that's what. I looked around for feed-specific
advertising services, and I found nothing but closed betas. I was
seriously surprised at the lack of services in this area. Anyone who
gets there first is going to have a serious advantage. Now, many someone
is there first, so let me rephrase it as "someone who gets there first,
in a noticeable way". It's enough to make a guy want a startup.

The dead-ends I've crawled back from in this pursuit must have been
littered with the sweat of others out there, looking for just this sort
of thing. Some places are doing in-feed advertising in-house, such as
Slashdot, but the rest of us are really left hanging. Every day I look
at my hits through Adsense and I really have to wonder what I'm missing.
If I'm getting so many people actually making their way to my page, how
many aren't even doing that much and just read it through the
aggregators and never browse to the site proper?

   <script type="text/javascript"><!-- google_ad_client = "pub-7984816525584511"; google_ad_width = 468; google_ad_height = 60; google_ad_format = "468x60_as"; google_ad_type = "text_image"; //2006-10-05: Ranting Techno Rave google_ad_channel ="8473164975"; google_color_border = "FFFFFF"; google_color_bg = "CAF99B"; google_color_link = "0000FF"; google_color_text = "000000"; google_color_url = "008000"; //--></script>


One might suppose that the "real" hits are more important anyway.
Those are the ones that really measure interest, not passive
consumption. That isn't what this is about, anyway. I need some cold,
hard cash.

What is everyone's opinion on the different routes? I'd like to know
both what anyone thinks personally and/or what experiences you've had
with the options available.

#. What is to be done about the feeds (which are great) taking users
   away from our sites? Does this change the perspective of the entire
   web?
#. What about our feeds being interlaced with advertising, text and
   banner?
#. What reaction, if any, should the public have to paid advertising
   posts by bloggers and are they worth it?
