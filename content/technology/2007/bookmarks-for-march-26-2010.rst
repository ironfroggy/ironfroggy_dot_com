-  `How I Create those Del.icio.us link posts -
   TechLifeBlogged <http://www.techlifeweb.com/2005/10/how-i-create-thos-delicious-link-posts.html>`__
   I am doing this now, but I stopped at the email so I can review and
   edit, rather than let it post automatically.
-  `Particletree » Visualizing Fitts’s
   Law <http://particletree.com/features/visualizing-fittss-law/>`__
   Great visual examples of how Fitt's Law works and why. Fitt's Law
   tells us that the difficulty of hitting a UI target is reliably
   predictable based on the distance and size of the target. Every
   designer or developer working with UIs should know this.
-  `Checklists <http://www.scotthorlbeck.com/code/tochecklist/>`__
   Exactly what I was looking for. Upgrades a select widget into a
   series of checkboxes, where we want toggle selection to be the
   default, not single selection.
-  `jquery-asmselect - Project Hosting on Google
   Code <http://code.google.com/p/jquery-asmselect/>`__
   Will likely use this, instead, because it seems to preserve the
   actual select, which toChecklist didn't do

.. raw:: html
