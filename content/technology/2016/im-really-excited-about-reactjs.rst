:title: I'm Really Excited About ReactJS

I’m really excited about ReactJS.

I’ve let my tentative excitement
grow for a while now, with a few experiments and tutorials and lots of
reading. There is a strong habit of Shiny New Thing syndrome in the
web world, and I’m as guilty of it as anyone else, so a lot of effort
was made to avoid jumping on the bandwagon too soon. After building my
first simple but complete application with ReactJS (and Flux) I’m not
absolutely convinced it is the best option for me to build web
interfaces going forward.

To share my excitement and to preserve my
thinking, in case I come back in a couple years wondering how I got
started with ReactJS, I’m going to outline all the reasons I’m so
excited about ReactJS.

ReactJS is Fast in Every Way That Matters
-----------------------------------------

Saying a software library is “fast” is often a red flag for not having
a holistic view of the trade offs. Faster than what? Fast by what
measurements and under which conditions? I can say that ReactJS is
fast because I’m not saying one vague thing, but saying ReactJS is
fast in all of the ways that it needs to be fast. It isn’t just fast
as software executing on a machine, but as a tool for humans
completing tasks.

ReactJS is Fast in the following ways.

- It doesn’t take long to get started with ReactJS. You can learn the basics to get
  started actually using it productively very quickly, without a lot of
  upfront costs or cutting corners that you wouldn’t in production
  usage. Learning has a very forgiving slope compared to some of the
  more complicated Javascript UI layers available to choose from these
  days.
- Owing largely to the simplicities that make learning ReactJS
  so fast and easy is the amazing swiftness with which you can actually
  develop within an application built with it. Refactoring that would
  take a day can be done in less than half an hour. Building new large
  components can be accomplished before you finish your cup of coffee.
  All the common development tasks around using ReactJS are just
  wonderfully streamlined. I think, more than most libraries, ReactJS
  was really able to consider its use by developers as a form of User
  Experience and optimized those experiences impressively.
- It is fast
  in the usual way people mean when they talk about software: the things
  it is built to do it does very quickly. It is largely defined by how
  amazingly it outperforms other DOM rendering options, owed in large
  part to its use of a virtual DOM layer.
- It doesn’t have a huge
  impact on page load sizes. Other options can add enormous costs to
  your page load, and while ReactJS isn’t necessary tiny it is one of
  the smallest libraries among those it would compete against in the
  same space. What’s more, if you need to make it even smaller you can
  try React Lite, a stripped down implementation of React that removes
  the server-side rendering most of us don’t use and comes in around 20k
  minimized with full API compatibility to drop in as a replacement for
  the full React. This is an amazing cost savings.

This library is fast to learn, fast to build with, fast at rendering your UI,
and fast to get to the user.

ReactJS can be a Small or Big Part of Your Project
--------------------------------------------------

There are two sides to a spectrum, in my opinion, to the way a library
or framework: either a library is a dependency with relatively little
weight compared to your own project or it is a larger thing within
which your project feels to simply “fit into”. This is the library
versus framework debate, and it took me a while to get a handle on
where ReactJS sits on this spectrum. It gets compared to Angular a lot
and compared among other Javascript frameworks, and for good reason as
it solves so many of the same problems and enjoys as vibrant an
ecosystem around it. But ReactJS’s own webpage describes it as a
library and, I think, deliberately.

What I’ve come to realize about
ReactJS is that it has managed to be both. It is easy and light enough
to be included as a dependency in a project even if you only needed it
for a single component, either one you needed to create in one
isolated part of your application or even if you included React as
only a secondary dependency of an off-the-shelf widget you found and
wanted to drop into your project. In this way it almost feels like
jQuery’s lightness, only there because its the glue so many plugins
depend on. At the same time, ReactJS and its Flux implementations can
serve as wider role in organizing a project and act as a foundation
upon with a huge ecosystem of helpers, tooling, and components are
blossoming faster than anyone can keep up with.

Simply put, ReactJS is
the only option I’ve found that feels it can work equally well as
either a small or large part of your project. This is very important
to me, because I have needs on both sides of that spectrum and I hate
the idea of needing to invest my time in so many different options for
so many different situations. I want to hold fewer things in my head
and narrow my focus. Generalization is nice and still important, but
there is a growing need for a specialization that is hard to achieve
with a constantly changing set of projects in my work.

ReactJS has Great Support
-------------------------

Finally, it is really important to look at a non-
technical aspect of a dependency before you depend on it very deeply.
There are many projects out there that fill the same shoes as ReactJS,
and some of them even have impressive accomplishments that objectively
set them apart from it! `Elm <http://elm-lang.org/>`__ and
`Mercury <https://github.com/Raynos/mercury>`__
and `Riot <http://riotjs.com/>`__ are great contenders beside
React, each with their own very positive attributes that set them
apart and make them absolutely great options.

Community and backing is
as important as technical considerations for many of us and in many
situations. In many cases, these are easily outweigh the technical
considerations. We need to depend on ecosystems within which we can
rely on the backing (Facebook in this case) and the community (React
is going to naturally attract more people than the clones it inspires)
and for my situations these aspects outweigh the many great reasons I
might otherwise have picked something a little more technically
exciting.

I’ve recently been looking into Redux, which sits beside
ReactJS and fills the Flux prescription Facebook is encouraging
everyone in the community towards. What really struck me as amazing is
how huge the ecosystem within just this one subset of React is and
that realization is what finally sold me.

Conclusion
----------

So, for the
foreseeable future my personal focus as a web developer is with feet
firmly planted in growing my understanding and experience with
ReactJS. I’m going to be building more small web apps to practice this
craft, using them as testbeds for learning new pieces of the ReactJS
landscape. I’m going to be building some of my own libraries and
components, sharing them with the community and writing about them
here.

I’m really excited about ReactJS.
