:title: React 15.0 Released!

I'm really excited to see the move in React from 0.14 to 15.0, signifying a level of maturity we
can rely on.

Still digging into the details, but it looks like we'll all benefit from many performance boosts,
complete SVG support, and lighter DOMs with the removal of the `data-reactid` data attribute. I'm
also happy to see that many extraneous `<span>` that has made my CSS selectors pained will now be
gone!

I've got some large React projects starting up right now and I'm very excited to see this landing
just in time!

Read very single word of `the press release <https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2016/04/07/react-v15.html>`_, like I did.
