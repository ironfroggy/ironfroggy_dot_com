I just thought this conversion should be preserved forÂ posterity.

    ldleworker: indeed
    I just need to fucking press through the general CSS refactor, then I
    can go back
    I really can't stand this for much longer
    also thanks for helping me figure that out
    ironfroggy: when i am stuck doing something i dont like that is a
    required part of the job which I do because of the parts I do like, I
    think about old school painters
    as in, pre-photography portraits
    a painter did so much more than paint, back then. They carved and
    stained the wooden frames, and they crafted their brushes
    they mixed paints from powders they ground up from various sources to
    produce the pigment
    they stretched cloths over the skeleton to make the canvas from hand
    they build their own easels, even.
    the point is, we look at "they painted" and we forget how much support
    work that required, and we're in the same boat.
    ldleworker: Yeah but at least when they are making their own brushes or
    carving their own easels physics worked the same no matter where they
    were standing.
