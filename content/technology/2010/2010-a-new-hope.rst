I couldn't have chosen a cheesier headline. I'm breaking my "How To
..." pattern of titles, but I figure this is probably for the best, and
when better to make a refreshing change? I still want to post more How
To articles, but I don't need to stick with the pattern for everything.
It gets difficult to twist some titles into the right shape, anyway.
Prediction posts are always a big thing the week before and after
January 1 and years ending with 0 always have even more of them. Why
should I miss out on a great meme that only comes around once a decade?
I'm going to mix it up a bit and give you more than a top ten
predictions on some random topic:
Developing Upwards presents,

My Top Five Lists of Top Ten Predictions for 2010
=================================================

This originally was written "My Top Ten Lists ...," but damn if I don't
wanna do that!
I apologize for anyone who just let out a huge groan. You can skip them,
if you want. The plan is to post one Top Ten Predictions list a day.
I'll update the list linking to them here. I had a few conversations
about predictions over the last week, and I really wanted to write them
all down in one place.

This post is about a bit more than just some predictions and hand
waving. This is also about a commitment: I need to commit to this blog
more. This isn't some stupid blogger mentality that blogging is
inherently awesome and should be the main focus of everything I do and
make me lots of money. The facts are simple.
When I blog more, I am happier. The posts give me a means to reflect on
what I've been working on and iron out thoughts that would only bounce
around in my skull, otherwise. Getting things down on (virtual) paper
gets them out of the destructive cycle of constantly bothering me. I
think we should all commit to solidifying our thoughts more often.
Allowing title flexibility is a part of that. I'm not going to force
myself to blog, but I'm going to put more into this than I used to. I
hope to do more than that. The name change a while back was one part of
a project that never got off the ground. I'll be moving this blog
somewhere I can control the software and do things I can't or don't like
the facilities for in Blogger.

I'll talk more about that in a post with more solidified thoughts.
