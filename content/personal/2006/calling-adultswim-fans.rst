Adult Swim fan? Thought to myself "would be nice to converse with
fellow fans during the block". Especially during Sunday nights.
Interested? Join ##adultswim over at irc.freenode.net, the next time
you're watching [as].

PS - The double #'s is due to an oft-critisized policy at freenode for
"non-official" channels to be moved to such a name, signifying it as an
"about channel", and allocating the single # channels as "official".
