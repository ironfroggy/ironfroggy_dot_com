How much are the descendants of Leonardo De Vinci making on the
copyright income for his work, these days? Must be pretty well off, as
much as his work is admired. And thank god for the lore of spoiled rich
great grandchildren to drive that fantastic man to create the works of
art and science he has given this world. Why, if left to his own self
motivation, he may have just been a (Venice boat person).

Thank god for the copyright on De Vinci's work!

And, thank god for good people who turn in the thieves and pirates, who
steal and mock such artists' works! Thank god for people who shut down
monsters that violate the rights of those artists.
