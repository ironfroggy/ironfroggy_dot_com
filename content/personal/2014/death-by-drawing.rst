A while back I joined the effort of my friend `Russell
Hay <http://twitter.com/russellhay>`__ to draw more often by way of a
blog dedicated just to posting our drawings. I'll be honest and say we
haven't made the best habits so far. I'm not giving up, so when I draw
it will be posted there. Every now and then I'll post a few things here,
just to remind you that I do that.

Tonight I draw a bunch of monsters!
