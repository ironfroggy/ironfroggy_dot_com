I've come across Buster Benson's attempt at a `Codex
Vitae <https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/master/Codex.md>`__,
which he got from Robin Sloan's `Mr Penumbra's 24-Hour
Bookstore <http://www.amazon.com/Mr-Penumbras-24-Hour-Bookstore-Novel/dp/1250037751>`__
and I'm hooked. This is an idea that has come to me on its own, and I've
made some personal attempts at it. But having a name for it, seeing
others pick up the idea, it makes it feel more validated and more real.

I am not sure what form my own Codex Vitae will take. Will it be
public or private? Will I update it ad hoc or develop some rules around
when and what to update? What topics are on and off the table for it?
But I've got literally the rest of my life to figure that out.

A project I can't finish until the moment I die? This is kind of
perfect for me.
