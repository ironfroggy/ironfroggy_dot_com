:title: Having a Holiday Break

Enjoying two weeks off for the holidays was a fabulous decision.

It isn't far into it, technically only one day if you don't count the weekend that would have been
there even if I didn't take a holiday, but I can already feel my stress fading away as I look
forward to Christmas, to time with my wife and son, to visiting my in-laws and to just enjoying my
home, with movies and video games and relaxing afternoons on the couch with the dog at my feet.

I've taken two weeks off, partly because I realized how much time I had saved up. I'm really happy
I can do so, but it also made me realize I need to take time off more often. I took three days off
in November to coincide with a school break of my son's and it was just so great.

I am going to make an effort to relax better and more pre-emptively.
