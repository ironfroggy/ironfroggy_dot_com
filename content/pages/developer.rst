I Am A Developer
################
:slug: developer

I have been a professional software developer for *Ten Years*.

I've spent most of those years working with Python and Javascript, focused on web development from
managing infrastructure and deployment systems to crafting intuitive, performant interfaces in
modern front-end technologies.

During this time I've used a lot of tools. I've been a Linux die-hard and a Mac convert. I've been
obsessed with the VIM editor and then thrown it away and jumped to the brand new Atom editor when it
was only only an Alpha release. I try to straddle a respect and promotion of free software with a
practical appreciation and understanding for the software ecologies other developers live in as
their realities.

My passion is balancing ideals and practical application.
